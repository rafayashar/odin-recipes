<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>28 oz (800g) boneless and skinless chicken thighs cut into bite-sized pieces</li>
    <li>1 cup plain yogurt</li>
    <li>1 1/2 tablespoons minced garlic</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon ginger</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons garam masala</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon turmeric</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon Kashmiri chili (or 1/2 teaspoon ground red chili powder)</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon of salt</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>In a bowl, combine chicken with all of the ingredients for the chicken marinade; let marinate for 10 minutes to an hour (or overnight if time allows).</li>
    <li>Heat oil in a large skillet or pot over medium-high heat. When sizzling, add chicken pieces in batches of two or three, making sure not to crowd the pan. Fry until browned for only 3 minutes on each side. Set aside and keep warm. (You will finish cooking the chicken in the sauce.) </li>
    <li>Melt the butter in the same pan. Fry the onions until soft (about 3 minutes) while scraping up any browned bits stuck on the bottom of the pan. </li>
    <li>Add garlic and ginger and saut√© for 1 minute until fragrant, then add garam masala, cumin, turmeric and coriander. Fry for about 20 seconds until fragrant, while stirring occasionally.</li>
    <li>Pour in the tomato puree, chili powders and salt. Let simmer for about 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally until sauce thickens and becomes a deep brown red colour.</li>
    <li>Stir the cream and sugar through the sauce. Add the chicken and its juices back into the pan and cook for an additional 8-10 minutes until chicken is cooked through and the sauce is thick and bubbling. Pour in the water to thin out the sauce, if needed.</li>
    <li>Garnish with cilantro (coriander) and serve with hot garlic butter rice and fresh homemade Naan bread!</li>
</ol>
